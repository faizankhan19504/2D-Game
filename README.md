# 2D-Game
2D Unity game where the player controls a spaceship (lander) on an alien world. The goal is to maneuver the ship for a perfect landing.  The game features 2D physics and challenges the player with a "crash" state if they land too fast or at a steep angle. The softer the landing, the better the score.
