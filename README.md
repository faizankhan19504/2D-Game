# 🚀🌑 **2D Lua Lander**

+ A retro-inspired **physics-based lunar lander game**, built in **Unity** using **C#**.  
+ This project was developed by following the [Code Monkey Unity Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zJjg8i3W3I) to practice Unity 2D physics, input handling, and collision systems.

### 🚀 **Features**

- 🌌 **Gravity & thrust mechanics** – Balance fuel and engine thrust to land safely.  
- 🛸 **Precision landing zones** – Touch down gently or explode on impact.  
- ⚖️ **Realistic 2D physics** – Built using Unity’s Rigidbody2D and collision system.  
- 💥 **Crash feedback** – Explosions and reset system for failed landings.  
- ⏳ **Challenge loop** – Retry endlessly until you perfect your landing.  
- 🎮 **Simple keyboard controls** for intuitive gameplay.

### 🧠 **Learning Objectives**

This project helped me practice and understand the following Unity and game development concepts:

- ⚖️ **Unity 2D Physics** – Applying forces with `Rigidbody2D`, handling collisions, and simulating gravity.  
- 🎮 **Player Input Handling** – Using Unity’s **Input System** to control thrust and rotation.  
- 🛸 **Game Logic** – Implementing win/lose conditions, crash detection, and landing checks.  
- 🖥️ **UI Management** – Displaying HUD elements like angle, score, and retry options.  
- 🧩 **Prefabs & Scenes** – Reusing game objects and structuring the project for scalability.  
- 🔊 **Sound Effects Integration** – Adding engine thrust, crash, and landing sounds.  
- 🗂️ **Project Organization** – Maintaining clean folder structures for scripts, assets, sounds, and prefabs.
